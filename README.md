**Briefly summarize the difference between SQL or NoSQL database.**

SQL databases are relational and uses tables with a variable number of rows and a fixed number of columns that have to be 
defined on the creation of the table. The tables and columns model the data of the kind of object to be stored. SQL databases
focuses on storing the data efficiently and avoiding duplication.

NoSQL databases are instead document-oriented and key-value databases which has an advantage in querying speed at the expense of 
duplicate entries.
